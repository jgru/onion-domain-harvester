# onion-domain-harvester
The OnionDomainHarvester is a python tool to harvest onion domains and store dem in a SQL DB. Onion domains are scraped from the hiddenwiki and several clear web webpages, which list onion-domains. The resulting database may be useful for assessing digital exhibits, so that darknet markets and other artifacts could be identified.
